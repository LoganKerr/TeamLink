## Setup

TeamLink runs on a [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) so make sure you have one set up before trying to setup the site

the database structure is stored in resources/db_schema. Please import it when it is updated and export it when you make changes.

When contributing code make sure you are on your own branch. NEVER PUSH TO MASTER. If you do, I will git blame u so hard ull call me admin. Create merge requests with master. Team Leader(Logan) will handle merges into master.

Please add more to me ;(
