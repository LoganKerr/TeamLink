## Setup

TeamLink runs on a [LAMP stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)) so make sure you have one set up before trying to setup the site

the database structure is stored in resources/db_schema. Please import it when it is updated and export it when you make changes.

If you need help with git please reference guides like [this](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

## Getting Started

When contributing code make sure you are on your own branch.NEVER PUSH TO MASTER. If you do, I will git blame u so hard ull call me admin. Create merge requests with master. Team Leader(Logan) will handle merges into master.

When you find issues or think of ideas, create an issue for them on the gitlab site. Don't be afraid to assign them to someone else or create new labels.

When you are unsure of what to work on, pick up a gitlab issue and assign it to yourself so no one else begins working on it.

## Creating merge requests

Merge requests must be made through [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/TeamLinkProject/TeamLink/merge_requests).

## Updating your branch

If you find your branch is behind master and want to update it, run ``` git merge master ``` when on your branch.

Note: Make sure you commit and push all changes before merging, or you will face merge conflicts.
